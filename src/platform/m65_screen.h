/* 80-column screen setup for the gopher client. See REQUIREMENTS.md
 * section 7 for the full story on why each of these steps exists --
 * skipping any of them causes either screen corruption (bad screen RAM
 * placement), a visual 40-column wrap despite being in 80-column pixel
 * mode (missing row-width register pokes), or interleaved garbled text
 * (mixing stdio printf()/puts() with conio cputc()/cputs()).
 *
 * RULE: once m65_screen_init() has run, never call stdio's printf()
 * or puts() again. For dynamic text, sprintf() into a local buffer then
 * display with cprintf() (cast to const unsigned char*) -- cputs()
 * doesn't interpret '\n', only cprintf()/_cprintf() does. */
